## Vendor
Ethereum blockchain

## Vulnerability Type
Incorrect Access Control

## Abstract
We found a vulnerability in the `UniswapFrontRunBot` Ethereum smart contract that can lead to financial losses. This vulnerability is due to incorrect access control which can lead to a reentrancy attack. This attack allows an attacker to withdraw more funds than they should be able to.

## Details
The `UniswapFrontRunBot` contract contains several functions that are vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. Specifically, the `start` and `withdrawal` functions transfer the contract's balance to an external address without any state change before the transfer. This could allow an attacker to re-enter the function during the call to the `transfer` function and extract funds multiple times.

Furthermore, the `setOwner` function can be called by anyone, allowing anyone to become the owner of the contract. This is a serious security issue because the owner can call the `withdrawal` function to withdraw all the funds in the contract.

Lastly, the `WETH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` are hardcoded to the same address. If these two addresses should be different, this could cause incorrect contract behavior.

## Attack Process

**Step 1** An attacker calls the `setOwner` function to become the owner of the contract.

**Step 2** The attacker calls the `start` function which transfers the contract's balance to an external address.

**Step 3** The external contract's fallback function is triggered, which calls the `start` function again, extracting more funds.

**Step 4** This process can be repeated until the contract's funds are depleted.

## Conclusion
This vulnerability is due to incorrect access control in the `UniswapFrontRunBot` contract. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it can lead to financial losses. It's recommended that access control is correctly implemented in the contract to prevent unauthorized access and potential reentrancy attacks.
